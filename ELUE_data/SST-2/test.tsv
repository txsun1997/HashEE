283	An endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .
284	The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .

304	Morton is , as usual , brilliant .
305	Even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the American Insomnia is still pretty darned good .
306	I do n't know precisely what to make of Steven Soderbergh 's Full Frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it .
307	The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .

309	I enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .
310	You could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that Alias Betty is predictable .

315	High on melodrama .
316	But it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
317	Finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .
318	It 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .
319	Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects .
320	He just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality .
321	Here , thankfully , they are .
322	Hu and Liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love .
323	This bold and lyrical first feature from Raja Amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .

340	Compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady .
341	It 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the Marks family .
342	A whole lot foul , freaky and funny .
343	Attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .
344	The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .

352	An intriguing and entertaining introduction to Johnson .
353	As expected , Sayles ' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances .
354	A model of what films like this should be like .
355	As Weber and Weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the Cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .
356	Yeah , these flicks are just that damn good .
357	Is n't it great ?
358	An unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .

361	Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .
362	A tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled African-American 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .

370	It 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss .

397	( Anderson ) uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense .
398	Bubba Ho-Tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by Bruce Campbell that does n't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .

418	Starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end .

425	... has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they 're ghosts imagining themselves as alive .
426	It 's a sly wink to The Others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic .
427	Long after you leave Justine , you 'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean .

437	There are moments in this account of the life of artist Frida Kahlo that are among cinema 's finest this year .
438	Unfortunately , they 're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of Kahlo 's life imaginable .

1126	The production values are up there .
1127	The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
1128	The voices are fine as well .
1129	The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
1130	It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
1131	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
1132	Well , it does go on forever .
1133	This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
1134	Topkapi this is not .
1135	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
1136	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .
1137	Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
1138	I 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
1139	While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
1140	If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
1141	A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
1142	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
1143	She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
1144	Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
1145	To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
1146	It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
1147	Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
1148	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
1149	For the most part , the ingredients are there .
1150	But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
1151	An earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
1152	It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
1153	A mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin 's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
1154	Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
1155	It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
1156	This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
1157	... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
1158	It 's a trifle .
1159	Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
1160	Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
1161	Anyway , for one reason or another , Crush turns into a dire drama partway through .
1162	After that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
1163	Too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss .
1164	Chao was Chen Kaige 's assistant for years in China .
1165	He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
1166	A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
1167	The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
1168	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
1169	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
1170	If it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than Half Past Dead .
1171	So what is the point ?
1172	Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
1173	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
1174	When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .
1175	When it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
1176	Most new movies have a bright sheen .
1177	Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
1178	The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
1179	You see Robert De Niro singing - and dancing to - West Side Story show tunes .
1180	Choose your reaction : A. ) That sure is funny !
1181	B. ) That sure is pathetic !
1182	A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
1183	This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw : Evil is interesting and good is boring .
1184	Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
1185	The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
1186	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
1187	But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
1188	A silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
1189	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
1190	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix .
1191	Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern 's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
1192	Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
1193	It 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in French ( well , mostly ) with English subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .
1194	This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
1195	Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
1196	Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clich√©s and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
1197	It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .
1198	It 's laughing at us .
1199	Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
1200	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
1201	For Benigni it was n't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
1202	It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
1203	Arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
1204	Both awful and appealing .
1205	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
1206	Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
1207	We are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
1208	Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
1209	It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
1210	I hated every minute of it .
1211	( T ) hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the Stepford Wives mentality does n't work in a modern context .
1212	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
1213	The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
1214	There 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
1215	A simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
1216	Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
1217	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
1218	Anthony Hopkins ?
1219	Big deal !
1220	We 've already seen the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
1221	Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
1222	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
1223	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
1224	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
1225	It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
1226	It 's just incredibly dull .
1227	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
1228	A cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
1229	Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
1230	But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
1231	Egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
1232	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
1233	Despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like ( Seinfeld 's ) revered TV show , about pretty much nothing .
1234	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
1235	Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
1236	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
1237	The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
1238	I 've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
1239	I wonder why .
1240	They felt like the same movie to me .
1241	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America 's Sweetheart .
1242	An ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
1243	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
1244	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .
1245	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
1246	That is essentially what 's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
1247	A compendium of Solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
1248	It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .
1249	The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
1250	You 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
1251	You 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
1252	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
1253	Ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
1254	Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
1255	Little more than a frothy vanity project .
1256	The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
1257	Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
1258	For all its surface frenzy , High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
1259	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
1260	Alex Nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget NC-17 version of Tank Girl .
1261	The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
1262	IHOPs do n't pile on this much syrup .
1263	For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
1264	focuses on Joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with Spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that I became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
1265	This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
1266	A bit of an unwieldy mess .
1267	With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual Broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
1268	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
1269	The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
1270	A gimmick in search of a movie : how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
1271	... the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs .
1272	... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
1273	... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
1274	It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
1275	It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
1276	Largely a for-fans artifact .
1277	There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
1278	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
1279	There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
1280	( I ) f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .
1281	No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
1282	A strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
1283	A boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
1284	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
1285	When the first few villians are introduced as `` Spider '' and `` Snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak .
1286	An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions .
1287	The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
1288	( Director ) Byler may yet have a great movie in him , but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one .
1289	So few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
1290	It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
1291	Watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
1292	It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
1293	There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
1294	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
1295	That 's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan 's existence .
1296	I did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
1297	The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
1298	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
1299	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
1300	Immediately .
1301	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
1302	( It 's ) a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
1303	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
1304	The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
1305	... ( a ) strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
1306	A sour , nasty offering .
1307	Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
1308	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
1309	It tells more than it shows .
1310	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
1311	The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
1312	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
1313	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
1314	Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
1315	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
1316	Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
1317	This is really just another genre picture .
1318	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
1319	William Shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ...
1320	A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
1321	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
1322	Acting , particularly by Tambor , almost makes `` Never Again '' worthwhile , but ( writer\/director ) Schaeffer should follow his titular advice
1323	Both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent I Spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .
1324	`` Collateral Damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
1325	` Enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
1326	A waste of good performances .
1327	A dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
1328	I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
1329	But I was n't .
1330	As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
1331	Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
1332	The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
1333	Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
1334	There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
1335	Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
1336	Why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson , Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED ?
1337	A broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
1338	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
1339	Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
1340	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
1341	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
1342	Wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of Hubert 's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
1343	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
1344	This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
1345	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
1346	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
1347	Kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth ( Mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world .
1348	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you 've imagined The Ring .
1349	This time Kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
1350	An intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
1351	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
1352	Frenetic but not really funny .
1353	Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
1354	If you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
1355	A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
1356	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
1357	You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
1358	Director Clare Kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
1359	New Best Friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
1360	Wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
1361	The thrill is ( long ) gone .
1362	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
1363	Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
1364	Godawful boring slug of a movie .
1365	Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
1366	Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
1367	... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
1368	It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
1369	It is also , at times , curiously moving .
1370	The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
1371	Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship .
1372	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
1373	Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
1374	But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
1375	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
1376	Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
1377	Aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
1378	Accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
1379	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
1380	A soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
1381	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
1382	Although based on a real-life person , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
1383	Great story , bad idea for a movie .
1384	With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams writer\/director\/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
1385	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
1386	It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
1387	`` My god , I 'm behaving like an idiot ! ''
1388	Yes , you are , Ben Kingsley .
1389	A dreadful live-action movie .
1390	Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
1391	An earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
1392	A hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations .
1393	All I can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
1394	Between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
1395	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
1396	Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
1397	Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
1398	A sensual performance from Abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
1399	Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
1400	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
1401	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
1402	Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
1403	The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
1404	Whatever Eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
1405	Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
1406	It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
1407	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
1408	It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
1409	I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
1410	A boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash .
1411	What you would end up with if you took Orwell , Bradbury , Kafka , George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender .
1412	But that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
1413	With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris , not to mention Sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate Fire 's bright side .
1414	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year 's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
1415	Writhing under dialogue like ` You 're from two different worlds ' and ` Tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .
1416	... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
1417	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco 's last album ?
1418	Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
1419	Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler 's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
1420	It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
1421	Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
1422	Some studio pizazz might have helped .
1423	When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
1424	There 's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
1425	Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
1426	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
1427	... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
1428	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
1429	If we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
1430	A modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
1431	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
1432	Morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .
1433	There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
1434	All Ms. Jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
1435	Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
1436	Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
1437	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
1438	This is n't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .
1439	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
1440	Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
1441	So clich√©d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
1442	It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
1443	It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
1444	When the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
1445	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
1446	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
1447	( Davis ) has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
1448	Does n't amount to much of anything .
1449	Bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
1450	So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
1451	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
1452	Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
1453	Some of Seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
1454	A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
1455	A long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
1456	A little too pat for its own good .
1457	There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
1458	Watching Trouble Every Day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
1459	Well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .
1460	What would Jesus do if He was a film director ?
1461	He 'd create a movie better than this .
1462	When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .
1463	A very bad sign .
1464	It 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
1465	Ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
1466	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
1467	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
1468	Almost everything else is wan .
1469	I 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
1470	Rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
1471	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
1472	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
1473	The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
1474	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
1475	Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
1476	Undercover Brother does n't go far enough .
1477	It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
1478	The film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
1479	Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
1480	You 've already seen Heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .
1481	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
1482	A journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking .
1483	The movie bounces all over the map .
1484	But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
1485	It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
1486	Not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
1487	It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
1488	You 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
1489	Feel bad for King , who 's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot .
1490	Some actors steal scenes .
1491	Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .
1492	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
1493	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
1494	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
1495	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
1496	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
1497	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .
1498	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
1499	There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
1500	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
1501	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
1502	The furious coherence that ( DeNiro ) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
1503	Oh , it 's extreme , all right .
1504	Extremely dumb .
1505	Extremely confusing .
1506	Extremely boring .
1507	We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
1508	For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
1509	One minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
1510	What happened with Pluto Nash ?
1511	How did it ever get made ?
1512	We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
1513	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''
1514	The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
1515	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
1516	A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan .
1517	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
1518	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
1519	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
1520	With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
1521	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
1522	A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
1523	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
1524	It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
1525	It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
1526	It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
1527	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
1528	This film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
1529	John McTiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
1530	It 's also stupider .
1531	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
1532	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
1533	As ( the characters ) get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
1534	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
1535	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
1536	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
1537	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
1538	Anyone who can count to five ( the film 's target market ? )
1539	can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
1540	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
1541	Demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
1542	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
1543	( Plays ) in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
1544	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
1545	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
1546	A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
1547	Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
1548	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate .
1549	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
1550	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
1551	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
1552	All that ( Powerpuff Girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .
1553	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
1554	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
1555	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
1556	As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
1557	Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
1558	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
1559	A great idea becomes a not-great movie .
1560	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
1561	And if The Hours wins ` Best Picture ' I just might .
1562	By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
1563	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .
1564	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
1565	Life is a crock -- or something like it .
1566	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
1567	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
1568	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
1569	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
1570	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .
1571	A bravura exercise in emptiness .
1572	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
1573	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
1574	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
1575	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
1576	First good , then bothersome .
1577	Excellent acting and direction .
1578	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1579	It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
1580	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
1581	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
1582	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
1583	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
1584	A long-winded , predictable scenario .
1585	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
1586	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
1587	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
1588	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
1589	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
1590	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
1591	Too bad the former Murphy Brown does n't pop Reese back .
1592	At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
1593	A real clunker .
1594	A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
1595	A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .
1596	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
1597	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
1598	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
1599	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
1600	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
1601	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
1602	Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .
1603	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
1604	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
1605	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
1606	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
1607	If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
1608	It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
1609	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
1610	Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
1611	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
1612	Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
1613	What kids will discover is a new collectible .
1614	What parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .
1615	Beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... ( but ) the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
1616	Without September 11 , Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie .
1617	Now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .
1618	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
1619	There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
1620	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
1621	Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
1622	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
1623	There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
1624	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
1625	When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
1626	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
1627	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
1628	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
1629	( It 's ) difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
1630	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
1631	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
1632	But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .
1633	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
1634	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
1635	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
1636	Overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it 's ) at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring .
1637	What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .
1638	If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
1639	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
1640	These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
1641	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
1642	It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
1643	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
1644	The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) .
1645	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
1646	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
1647	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
1648	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
1649	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
1650	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .
1651	Too simple for its own good .
1652	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
1653	A chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
1654	Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
1655	The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
1656	All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
1657	A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
1658	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
1659	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
1660	Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
1661	As Tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne TV sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
1662	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .
1663	The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
1664	A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .
1665	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .
1666	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
1667	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?
1668	Ridiculous .
1669	What 's next ?
1670	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
1671	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
1672	The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
1673	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
1674	These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
1675	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
1676	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .
1677	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
1678	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
1679	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
1680	No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
1681	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
1682	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
1683	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
1684	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
1685	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
1686	The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
1687	The parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York ) .
1688	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .
1689	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
1690	It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
1691	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
1692	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
1693	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .
1694	Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .
1695	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
1696	Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
1697	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .
1698	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
1699	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
1700	There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
1701	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
1702	An awkward and indigestible movie .
1703	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
1704	Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .
1705	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
1706	All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
1707	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
1708	There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
1709	This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
1710	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
1711	Alas , it 's neither .
1712	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
1713	` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
1714	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
1715	Now it 's just tired .
1716	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
1717	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
1718	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .
1719	A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
1720	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
1721	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
1722	It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
1723	But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .
1724	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
1725	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
1726	What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
1727	Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .
1728	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
1729	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
1730	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
1731	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
1732	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
1733	I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
1734	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
1735	With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
1736	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
1737	Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .
1738	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
1739	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
1740	Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
1741	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
1742	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
1743	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
1744	Or a profit .
1745	Or some damn thing .
1746	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
1747	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
1748	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
1749	I like Frank the Pug , though .
1750	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
1751	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
1752	Moot point .
1753	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
1754	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
1755	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
1756	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
1757	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
1758	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
1759	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
1760	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
1761	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
1762	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
1763	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
1764	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
1765	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
1766	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
1767	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
1768	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
1769	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
1770	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
1771	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
1772	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
1773	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
1774	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
1775	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
1776	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
1777	Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
1778	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
1779	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
1780	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
1781	A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
1782	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
1783	Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
1784	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .
1785	When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
1786	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
1787	We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
1788	Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing ( the movie 's ) mindset .
1789	Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
1790	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
1791	Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
1792	( Nelson 's ) movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
1793	Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
1794	For me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
1795	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
1796	Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .
1797	Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
1798	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
1799	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
1800	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
1801	The movie gets muted and routine .
1802	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
1803	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
1804	It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
1805	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
1806	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
1807	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
1808	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
1809	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
1810	Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
1811	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
1812	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
1813	A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
1814	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
1815	It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
1816	In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
1817	It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
1818	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
1819	You 've seen them a million times .
1820	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
1821	This one does .
1822	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
1823	A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
1824	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
1825	An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...
1826	A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
1827	An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
1828	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
1829	After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
1830	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
1831	A gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of Moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid cr√®me br√ªl√©e .
1832	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
1833	Boring we did n't .
1834	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to Barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
1835	The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
1836	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
1837	A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie ( Woody Allen ) has made in the last twenty years .
1838	It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
1839	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
1840	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
1841	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
1842	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
1843	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
1844	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
1845	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
1846	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
1847	If I Spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
1848	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
1849	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
1850	A very average science fiction film .
1851	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
1852	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
1853	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
1854	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
1855	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
1856	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
1857	A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
1858	Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .
1859	Or , you can do something fun tonight .
1860	Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
1861	As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
1862	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
1863	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
1864	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
1865	When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
1866	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
1867	While Benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
1868	Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
1869	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
1870	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
1871	None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
1872	... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
1873	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
1874	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
1875	... has virtually no script at all ...
1876	Will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
1877	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
1878	But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick ( remember Cabin Boy ? )
1879	just pound away .
1880	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
1881	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
1882	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
1883	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
1884	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
1885	The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
1886	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
1887	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
1888	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
1889	The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
1890	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
1891	There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
1892	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
1893	Sorry , Charlie
1894	A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
1895	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
1896	And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
1897	The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
1898	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
1899	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
1900	All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
1901	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
1902	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
1903	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
1904	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
1905	( Two ) fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
1906	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
1907	The central story lacks punch .
1908	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
1909	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
1910	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
1911	A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
1912	What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
1913	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
1914	`` Men in Black II , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel .
1915	The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
1916	Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
1917	This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
1918	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
1919	A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
1920	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
1921	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
1922	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
1923	A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
1924	Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .
1925	A well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
1926	The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
1927	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
1928	Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
1929	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
1930	It 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
1931	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
1932	This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
1933	Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
1934	While obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .
1935	Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
1936	Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
1937	I loved looking at this movie .
1938	I just did n't care as much for the story .
1939	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
1940	It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
1941	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
1942	A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
1943	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
1944	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
1945	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
1946	It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
1947	Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
1948	A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
1949	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
1950	Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
1951	Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
1952	To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
1953	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
1954	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
1955	Ecks this one off your must-see list .
1956	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .
1957	It settles for being merely grim .
1958	The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
1959	It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
1960	No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
1961	Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
1962	Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half .
1963	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
1964	The New Guy is one of them .
1965	This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
1966	Everything that 's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
1967	If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
1968	Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
1969	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
1970	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .
1971	All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
1972	Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
1973	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
1974	The film 's center will not hold .
1975	Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
1976	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
1977	A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending .
1978	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
1979	Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
1980	As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
1981	A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
1982	I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
1983	Nothing about it fits .
1984	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
1985	Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
1986	The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
1987	Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
1988	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
1989	I tried to read the time on my watch .
1990	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
1991	Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
1992	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
1993	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
1994	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
1995	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
1996	Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
1997	There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
1998	It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
1999	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
2000	Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
2001	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
2002	Just a bloody mess .
2003	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
2004	You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
2005	Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
2006	Bears is bad .
2007	Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .
2008	As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
2009	George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
2010	For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
2011	However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
2012	Extreme Oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it .
2013	What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
2014	What will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
2015	... too dull to enjoy .
2016	A morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-TV look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense .
2017	Here 's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
2018	Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
2019	But even a hero can stumble sometimes .
2020	A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
2021	It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
2022	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
2023	Going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film .
2024	Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
2025	Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
2026	Admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .
2027	For Caine Lovers only .
2028	A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
2029	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
2030	But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
2031	No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
2032	A reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .
2033	The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
2034	Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
2035	City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
2036	But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
2037	The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
2038	What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
2039	The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
2040	Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .
2041	A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement .
2042	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
2043	Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
2044	And forget about any attempt at a plot !
2045	It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
2046	Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .
2047	It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
2048	Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
2049	It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
2050	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
2051	` How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
2052	Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
2053	Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .
2054	The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
2055	Barely goes beyond comic book status .
2056	It 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
2057	I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
2058	It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
2059	An eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
2060	Afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , All the Queen 's Men is finally just one long drag .
2061	Maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
2062	( Morgan ) , Judd and Franklin ca n't save the script , rooted in a novel by Joseph Finder , from some opportunism .
2063	Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
2064	Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .
2065	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
2066	Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
2067	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
2068	It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
2069	It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
2070	A sudsy cautionary tale .
2071	A movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a Bolly-Holly masala mess .
2072	Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
2073	Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I 'd hoped the movie would avoid .
2074	Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
2075	Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
2076	As your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
2077	Unfortunately , as a writer , Mr. Montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
2078	On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
2079	The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
2080	One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
2081	... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
2082	Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
2083	The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
2084	Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .
2085	( Sen 's ) soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
2086	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
2087	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
2088	Do n't waste your money .
2089	Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
2090	There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
2091	There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
2092	Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
2093	We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict .
2094	You 're better off staying home and watching The X-Files .
2095	Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
2096	Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
2097	This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
2098	Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it 's called Where 's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?
2099	This film is full of rabbits .
2100	Brimful .
2101	But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
2102	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
2103	I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo-ha .
2104	No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
2105	A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to .
2106	Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
2107	In a word -- yes .
2108	If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
2109	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
2110	The movie makes absolutely no sense .
2111	Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
2112	The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
2113	Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
2114	Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
2115	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
2116	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
2117	That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
2118	The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
2119	The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
2120	This is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .
2121	Parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde 's still-contemporary play .
2122	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
2123	A TV episode inflated past its natural length .
2124	Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
2125	All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
2126	There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
2127	The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
2128	The story ... is moldy and obvious .
2129	It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
2130	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
2131	Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
2132	Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
2133	Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
2134	Usually when I get this much syrup , I like pancakes to go with it .
2135	All the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
2136	Glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
2137	Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
2138	An overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .
2139	Without a strong script and energetic acting , Dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos .
2140	A mild , reluctant , thumbs down .
2141	Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .
2142	Schindler 's List it ai n't .
2143	A cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .
2144	It 's an awfully derivative story .
2145	It 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
2146	About as cutting-edge as Pet Rock : The Movie .
2147	With generic sets and B-grade special effects , Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as TV 's defunct Cleopatra 2525 .
2148	Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
2149	Winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
2150	Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
2151	The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
2152	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
2153	With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious .
2154	It 's painful .
2155	An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
2156	Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
2157	An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
2158	Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
2159	Writer\/director John McKay ignites some charming chemistry between Kate and Jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and Kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
2160	( Newton ) wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
2161	Unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .
2162	I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
2163	A lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
2164	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
2165	Then lower them a bit more .
2166	When not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray 's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean .
2167	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
2168	A woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
2169	` Abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let Dante 's gloomy words be your guide .
2170	What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .
2171	A grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
2172	Birot 's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with Christophe Honor√© ) is n't so much bad as it is bland .
2173	Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
2174	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
2175	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
2176	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
2177	If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
2178	A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience .
2179	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
2180	`` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
2181	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
2182	What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
2183	The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
2184	While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
2185	Just how extreme are these ops ?
2186	I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
2187	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
2188	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
2189	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
2190	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
2191	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
2192	The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
2193	The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
2194	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
2195	It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
2196	A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
2197	None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
2198	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
2199	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
2200	Fails to bring as much to the table .
2201	A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .
2202	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
2203	If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
2204	I hate this movie
2205	An imaginative comedy\/thriller .
2206	( A ) rare , beautiful film .
2207	( An ) hilarious romantic comedy .
2208	Never ( sinks ) into exploitation .
2209	( U ) nrelentingly stupid .
